## Descriptions:

### 911 Data Capstone Project
I was assigned to this project in my course. I have analyzed some 911 call data from Kaggle's dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert).

### Finance Data Capstone Project
I was assigned to this project in my course. In this data project, I have performed exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice. I have focused on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016."></a>

### Linear Regression Project
I was assigned this case study during the course, and based on it, I developed a model for an Ecommerce company in New York City. The company aims to determine whether to prioritize its mobile app or website for customers who attend in-store style sessions before making online clothing orders. The goal is to optimize the user experience and enhance their decision-making process between the two platforms.

### Stock Market Price Prediction Project
This was my semester 3 Python project where I had to cleaned data in Excel, stored in MySQL as 'daily price' table. Queried data using Python, extracted relevant features into a data frame. Employed feature engineering techniques, including technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD). Utilized regression and Random Forest Classifier for stock price prediction, chosen for handling large datasets and accuracy. Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy.

### Flask Project
This was my semester 3 full-stack development project, where I learned Flask from my Coursera course 'Creating your first web page with Python and Flask,' and I've uploaded the certificate in my repository. The project entails a website providing stock market predictions and news. It includes Home, Prediction, News, Learn, About Us, and Contact Us sections. The Home page showcases company images, Prediction offers next day closing price, News provides daily news via an accordion, Learn imparts quick tips on indicators, About Us showcases company details, and Contact Us is a modal in the navigation bar. App.py links the pages, handles database, and performs predictive calculations.

### Mobile service center project
I developed a mobile and laptop service center code in python for both customers and staff, enabling service requests, cost estimation, service tracking, and management. The Owner class authenticated users, managed data, and provided various functionalities. The Customer class facilitated logins, registrations, and work status checks. The program efficiently calculated service costs and completion times based on device type and service, enhancing overall service center operations.

### Logistic Regression Project
I was assigned this project in my udemy course where I had to work with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. I tried to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

### KNN Project
I was assigned this project in my udemy course where I was given a made-up data set and I had to perform KNN algorithm to build a model out of it.

### K Means Clustering Project
I was assigned this project in my udemy course where I had to attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

### SVM Project
I was assigned this project in my udemy course where I had to apply SVM algorithm on the [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

### Recommender System Project
I did this guided project in my udemy course where I had to provide basic recommender system by suggesting movies that are most similar to a particular movie. So it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.

### NLP Project
I was assigned this project in my udemy course where I had to attempt to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. I used the Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013).
